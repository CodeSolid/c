# Some CMake Tutorial Solutions

This folder contains some worked-through (functional) solutions based on the code for the [CMake tutorial](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/index.html) (Version 3.27.1).

It can be used in conjunction with the container built in the project ../gcc_cmake_tutorial and described in the article [Running the CMake Tutorial in a VS Code Dev Container](https://codesolid.com/running-the-cmake-tutorial-in-a-vs-code-dev-container/#htoc-using-vs-code-s-dev-container-extension).

To date not all sections of the tutorial have complete solutions.  Those that are can be built using the (Gnu Make) Makefile in the ./source directory.
