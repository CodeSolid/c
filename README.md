# C

C and C++ tutorials and demos for [CodeSolid.com](https://codesolid.com).

## Usable

* [gcc_docker_basic](./gcc_docker_basic/) -- Using the gcc docker container to compile and run simple programs in C and C++.

* [gcc_with_cmake](./gcc_with_cmake/) -- Dockerfile, bash script, and instructions to build a container containing gcc w/ CMake built from source.

[gcc_cmake_tutorial](./gcc_cmake_tutorial/) -- Multi-stage build that adds gcc to cmake as in [gcc_with_cmake](./gcc_with_cmake/), then gets the source for the corresponding CMake tutorial into /source.

## Planned / In Progress

* Article for debugging remotely into tutorial -- encompasses work so far, and how to use gcc_cmake_tutorial with the "Dev Containers" VS Code plugin.  Perhaps more to do on gcc_cmake_tutorial in conjunction with this.
